* validate the form using a javascript function (all fields are required, at least 1 checkbox must be checked). all javascript should be in a separate file (validate.js)
* if the form is valid, output the user-entered values in a formatted div tag
* if the form is not valid, output an error message on each offending control. there should be an error message next to each control that is invalid. all error messages should be presented at the same time. if there are multiple errors, all error messages need to show up when the user clicks the validate button.
* You CANNOT use innerHTML for this project. If you use innerHTML to change the html content, you will receive a zero on the project.
